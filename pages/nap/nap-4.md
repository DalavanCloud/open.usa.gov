The purpose of the National Action Plans is to advance transparency, accountability, participation, and/or technological innovation across government. This page is for the co-creation of the fourth National Action Plan between government and civil society. 

You can learn more about U.S. Open Government Initiatives at [open.usa.gov](https://open.usa.gov).

The fourth National Action Plan is scheduled to be released in October 2017 with the list of US commitments to advance transparency, accountability, participation, and/or technological innovation across government. This is your opportunity to suggest and/or comment on framework and ideas presented below.
