The purpose of the National Action Plans is to advance transparency, accountability, participation, and/or technological innovation across government. This page is for the co-creation of the fourth National Action Plan between government and civil society. 

Examples of past commitments achieved through the National Action Plan include:

* [We the People](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov): One of the first and most prominent open government commitments, the We the People petitions site has led to major reforms in the United States and has also offered two-way engagement for millions of users.
* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov): Opening data to the public has a wide ripple-effect. Data.gov today is home to approximately 200,000 datasets for industry, academic, and other use.
* [USAspending.gov](https://beta.usaspending.gov): Transforming nearly $4 trillion taxpayer dollars into Open Data, so taxpayers can see the breakdown of where their dollars go in government.

You can learn more about U.S. Open Government Initiatives at [open.usa.gov](https://open.usa.gov).

The fourth National Action Plan is scheduled to be released in October 2017 with the list of US commitments to advance transparency, accountability, participation, and/or technological innovation across government.
